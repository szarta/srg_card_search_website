## The Competitor

[[[Leader of the Postal Nation]]]

## Writeup

Drew and Trey reviewed this on Stacked Card #17.  Pretty standard shuffles to
draw.  Submission search either gets the weakest stop or the most protected finish.
[[All American Headlock]] - if the stop is dead you can shuffle 2 cards from
discard into deck and draw a card.
