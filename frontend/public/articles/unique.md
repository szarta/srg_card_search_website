## The Competitor

[[[Unique]]]

## Writeup

This deck was reviewed by Trey and Drew on Stacked Card #19.  Johnny Korea won
a CAC tournament with this deck.

The nice thing about [[Never Settle for Less Than Elle Diablo]] is you can
search and discard a dead stop or the spotlight sub finish [[Spitting Blood]].
[[Never Settle for Less Than Elle Diablo]] is always good in powerful spotlight
decks, and good spotlight finishers are the reason people will run 
[[Impact is Family (V2)]] in open tournaments.

Drew will almost always run [[Big Body Block]] due to most people running
[[Apocalypse]] and spamming it.

Johnny mentioned he'd normally run 3 [[Restoration Potion #8]] effects, but
switch up this time due to knowing Ring of Fire stipulation was in top cut.
He also normally run's 2 [[Destiny's Call (V2)]] effects, but ran [[Muay Thai
Strikes]] instead.

The [[Anarchy's Shovel (Unique)]] is completely devastating, and the recursion
in this deck can hurt.
