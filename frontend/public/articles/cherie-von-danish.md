## Writeup

Observed this deck on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkxmjItjH34 around the
37 minute mark.

Played against Ref Dave playing (post-nerf) 64-bit Casey.

Cards I did not see in the match: #19, #21, #22, #25.  

Filling in the empty cards is left as an exercise to the reader unless Yaz
contacts me with the details.
