[[[Wendigo]]]

## Writeup

This deck lost in an Underworld title match to a defending [[12 Grapple Matt]].
Trey and Drew review it on Stacked Card #17.  Reveal stops at 1-3 essentially 
let you draw 2 with Wendigo.  Plan was to push Grapple since  
[[12 Grapple Matt]] did not have a 13 stop active.

Turn the Tables with finish strike lets you put cards into play with Wendigo.
