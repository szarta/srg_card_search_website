## The Competitor

[[[Moonstar]]]


## Writeup

Went undefeated tonight at the Rip N Ship Arena with this beauty of a deck. The
list itself felt great and had insane combos. As crazy as it sounds one of the
biggest changes I would consider is adding rejected which sounds counter
productive to the spotlight but people don’t understand how good this
competitor is at controlling the opponent when they have a deck, so if I can
potentially set them way back multiple times it can be a nice swing. With that
change I would consider using [[Standing Moonsault]] at #22 instead to search and
filter out the finisher again, or even the grapple finish. Changing
[[Chugga-Chugga-Chugga-Chugga-Chugga-Chugga-Chug! (Agility)]] into [[Submerge]]
can be an option too but you don’t want to over commit to the gimmick
too much or you may be in trouble if you get blanked!

Noteworthy interactions in the deck itself:

- Once your finish sub hits the discard pile, all your cards that interact with
  the discard basically turn into take any card.

- Your [[Razor Whip]] and [[Imperial Stretch]] turn into a [[Drawin' Dimes (V2)]]
  being able to take any card back.

- Your [[Choke on the Smoke (Submission)]] not only helps get the spotlight faster but if
  you choose discard you have the option at 2 submissions and any one card.

- When at deck out all your friendly bury stops basically become fight in the
  dog cards for you as you get to basically switch and choose what you want to
  bury from your discard after your opponent chooses.

- Moon and star cards aren’t great but they are playable, [[Springboard Moonsault]]
  becomes shuffle 1 strike and any 1 card with the spotlight. A lot of times I
  found myself decked out and my play was to pass and bury that or [[Moon Drop]]
  knowing I would be able to set up my combo. The finish grapple is your end game
  and it doesn’t hit hard unless you set up these cards.

- Playing [[Crowd Pleaser]] with [[Getting Over]] in discard also basically
  says pick up any card with the spotlight.

Interactions from my opponents cards tonight that people may not realize:

- With your spotlight live, unless the opponent only has 1 card in
  their discard pile, your opponent very rarely can get back what they want from
  the discard once a card is there.

- Friendly buries goes both ways, you never really get hurt by them as you
  choose what’s buried.

- Pretty much Candy/pretzel/corn bread proof. Spotlight or not, you usually
  will be protected with your gimmick on swapping one of the buried cards. I
  had a game where I was decked out and my opponent couldn’t throw candy cause
  I would just bury the flipped card anyway.

- Nothing feels better then watching a [[Summoning Circle]] finally pop and you
  handing them a punch from their discard pile

- I watched a sweet and salty, [[You're Not Ready]], crossbow and a recovering
  finish all turn into a ring post bumper, all in one game.

- Cards like the fight in the dog line and seven seals line just lose so much
  power for the opponent, just continuously give them back grapples that walk
  into your moon and star cards and hit the finish grapple with ridiculous
  bonuses. At CM1 with the +2 your finish roll is 13 12 11 11 10 9.

Overall the deck felt almost unfair for the opponent, they had to play the long
game which I also was able to make my short game even shorter, and all without
any Spotlight Spam to do it.
