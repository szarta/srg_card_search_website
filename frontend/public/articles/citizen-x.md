## The Competitor

[[[Citizen X]]]

This is my first build, taking some of the cards I have and building around
Citizen X.

### Pros ###

The main appeal here for the Gimmick is if the opponent draws, they
have to bury a card.  This can nullify a "draw 1" if their hand is otherwise
empty, so the goal will be to try to whittle down their hand.  This turns off
or makes worse their cards that let them draw.  Similarly, plenty of cards we
might play require us and our opponent to draw 1, which can be seen as
balanced, but could be turned into net card advantage if having the opponent
draw is no longer beneficial.

TLDR:
- Weakens their self-draw
- Transforms draw we play to be one-sided advantage
- Highest benefit when they have no/few cards in hand, boosting the value of
  any discard we play
- Long term net card advantage to us

### Cons ###

Obviously if they have good draw cards to begin with, that will negate the
downside of the Gimmick.  Furthermore, if they actually **want** to bury cards in
hand - i.e. they can draw from the bottom of their deck or otherwise want to
cycle through cards in hand to get their ideal cards in hand, that will
backfire or at least negate some of the advantage we get.  A shorter game can
negate any perceived card advantage we might get from the Gimmick.  And, like
most build-around decks, it can leave us with some pretty mediocre cards if our
Gimmick gets blanked.

TLDR:
- Can get overwhelmed by good draw/hand resets
- Opponent might actually want to bury cards, draw from bottom
- 1-sided draw is not so 1-sided, it is still given opponent card selection if
  their hand is not empty
- Needs a longer game to realize card advantage
- Blanked Gimmick turns 1-sided cards back into "fair" cards


### One-Sided Draw ###

What I mean is cards like:

[[[Aid From the SRG Mom]]]
[[[Snap Punch]]]

These would normally let both players draw 1 card, but with the Gimmick, it
becomes a "draw 1, bury 1" for the opponent.  The Gimmick lets the add-on
effect of the cards feel less painful.  It also makes any such cards played by
the opponent even worse (again, assuming the opponent does not actually want to
bury cards).
